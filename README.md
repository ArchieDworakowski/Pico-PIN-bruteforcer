# Pico PIN bruteforcer

This is my code to have the Raspberry pi Pico emulate a USB keyboard, and automatically attempt all possible 4 digit PINs.



## Installation

Install CircuitPython to Pico, and add the code.py, combos.txt, and adafruid_hid library

## Roadmap

- Add handling for lockouts for too many attempts

- Add handling for when Pico correctly guesses PIN

- Add more choice of PINs to try (e.e choose amount of digits etc.)

## Bugs

- Numbers are occasionally omitted
